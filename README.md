# Test-problems-for-OTR-scheduling-under-uncertainty
Welcome to my GitHub repository!

In this repository, I have shared the data for our paper "Efficient Scheduling of Integrated Operating Rooms and Post-Anesthesia Care Units Under Uncertain Surgery and Recovery Times: An Artificial Neural Network-Metaheuristic Framework". I hope that my work can be of assistance to those who are interested in the operating room planning and scheduling problems. Please feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Additionally, I would like to note that the data in this repository is based on real hospital data from two papers in the literature entitled "Operating room scheduling problem under uncertainty: Application of continuous phase-type distributions" and "Simulation optimisation for operating room scheduling".

I encourage you to look at the paper for a deeper understanding of the problem being solved and the methodology used.

I appreciate your interest in our work.
